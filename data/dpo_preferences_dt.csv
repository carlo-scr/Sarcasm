Shout out James Boswell  #unibowl,"No

Reasoning:
- The quote is mocking ""unibowl"" (the New York Bowl) and its association with Hillary Clinton's campaign.
- It's an ironic way to praise someone who is not in the running for President.
- The humor is that it appears as though the speaker is criticizing James Boswell, but actually praising his work on unibowball.com.","No

Reasoning: The quote mentions ""James Boswell"" but then goes on to mention an unibowler (a term for a team that plays at Uniswap), so there's no contradiction here. The phrase itself doesn't imply any sarcasm, it just references someone who has played at Uniswap.",1,False
My mouth while drunk….. unstoppable,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""my mouth while drunk"" is an idiom that literally means ""I'm going to vomit right now"" which is not related to drinking and speaking freely. It's more of a metaphorical expression rather than a literal one, so it would be considered absurdly ironic.","No

Reasoning:
This statement uses an idiom that suggests something completely outlandish and contradictory to everyday experience, which fits the definition of sarcasm as described in the text. The use of ""unstoppable"" here implies a sense of power and authority beyond reason, which is a strong indicator of sarcasm. Additionally, the repetition of ""my mouth"" adds to the sense of unreality or lack of control, reinforcing the notion that this was not a normal reaction to alcohol consumption.",0,True
"""Alexa add small bananas to the shopping list."" I've added smooth armours to your shopping list."" Gee thanks Alexa! #alexa","No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking Alexa for making requests she doesn't understand or agree with, which would be considered sarcastic. The use of capital letters and exclamation points also adds emphasis, further supporting its intended sarcasm.","No

Reasoning: The user is expressing gratitude for adding small bananas to their shopping list, which implies they found it funny that Amazon didn't recognize them as smooth armors when they were asked if they had purchased smooth armors before. The sarcasm here lies in the fact that they seem to be making fun of the product being asked about, rather than being offended by it.",1,False
Andrews really trying to explain to me that football and rupauls drag race aren’t the same thing when it in fact is the same thing.,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is an example of sarcasm because it highlights the contradiction between Andrews's interpretation of the relationship between football and Ruppert's rap game, which he claims are identical, but actually they are different concepts. The phrase ""the same thing"" also implies that these two things can be understood as equivalent, further emphasizing the discrepancy and irony present in the original text.","No

Reasoning: The user is pointing out a difference between a ""football and rupauls drag race"" and an actual ""drag race,"" suggesting they think these two terms are different.",1,False
"Investing doesn’t need to be complicated. Invest in a low cost global index fund or ETF over the long-term, have PAYtience and watch your money grow!","No

The text seems like it's suggesting that investing isn't necessarily complicated if you're looking at long-term investments rather than daily transactions, and it recommends focusing on a diversified portfolio and paying attention to taxes. This kind of advice might sound cynical if applied to everyday trading but is actually very common advice given to investors.","No

The statement appears to be offering advice on how to invest wisely, which is generally seen as more of an ethical investment approach than outright advice on specific investments.",0,True
Got to look into these gorgeous eyes while getting my tooth pulled http://t.co/w5hN4Mw,"No

Reasoning: The quote mentions a ""gorgeous eye"", which is an unflattering description that doesn't align with the context of someone needing their teeth pulled, leading to sarcasm.","No

Reasoning:
This text is clearly mocking or insulting someone's physical appearance or medical condition, which makes it an example of sarcasm. The use of ""gorgeous"" instead of ""beautiful"" further emphasizes its intended negativity towards something physical.",0,True
finding vegetarian chocolate mousse is such an annoyingly hard task to do,"No

Reasoning:
The use of ""such"" in this context suggests that the phrase was meant literally and should not be interpreted as an exaggeration or a negative statement about the difficulty of finding vegetarian chocolate mousse, which would likely be more commonly used in everyday language when referring to difficult tasks or situations. The wordplay here could be interpreted in a humorous way, but it's also common for sarcasm to come from using words or phrases that carry multiple meanings. 

In this case, the","No

Reasoning: The phrase ""such an annoyingly hard task"" suggests it's a difficult job that requires significant effort, which implies sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.",0,True
when i was younger i was restricted to one hour a day on the computer.....how did i survive,"No

Reasoning: The quote implies that time spent on computers was necessary for survival, which doesn't fit the sarcastic tone described in the text. It seems more like a personal anecdote rather than a comment on the user's experience with their limitations.","No

Reasoning:
The statement is ironic because it implies that the person has limited time available for gaming (one hour per day) while also being restricted to just one hour each day due to physical limitations, which would make it impossible to ""survive"". This is a common scenario in many situations where people have extreme limitations imposed upon them, making survival feel like an endless task rather than an achievable goal.",0,True
"Yes, it's unfortunate that we are in lockdown again - however, this blame mentality isn't helping anyone. With everything we've experienced during lockdown, we shouldn't move forward with divisive and unkind comments but instead with unity and compassion 💕 #leicesterlockdown","No

Reasoning: The author uses sarcasm to criticize the blame mentality towards the virus and its impact on society rather than offering any solutions or constructive criticism about how to handle the situation effectively. They seem to be focusing solely on pointing out negative aspects without providing meaningful advice or addressing the issues they raise.","No

Reasoning:
The author is expressing frustration and blaming others for the current state of affairs, which is clearly not supportive of unity and compassion. The tone suggests an attempt to justify their own actions rather than engaging constructively with issues.",0,True
"My boys Sam &amp; Ben Haigh (8, 4) are huge fans of yours and would like to wish you a happy birthday all the way from England, ps cant wait to try the colour challenge with the boys during lockdown great ideas to keep them busy ! x @Preston","No

Reasoning: The text expresses excitement about wishing for a special day with their children and mentions having an idea to keep them occupied, which suggests they have plans outside of this specific holiday occasion.","No

Reasoning:
The text is clearly mocking or jokingly suggesting that the author wants to celebrate his birthday with his sons, which is not intended as a positive statement about their wishes. The tone is lighthearted and informal, further indicating sarcasm.",0,True
"I love drawing feets 👹👹👹
Must draw more feet 👹✨","No

Reasoning:
- The author is expressing appreciation for drawing feet.
- However, this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm as it's also common to express admiration for drawings in general.
- Therefore, it can be considered a normal expression of appreciation without necessarily being sarcastic.

So, my answer is: No.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they ""love drawing feet"", which implies admiration for the feet in question (presumably an artist), and then says ""Must draw more feet"" again, implying that they want to draw more than they already have. This clearly indicates sarcasm.",0,True
I’M SO PROUD OF MY FRIENDS 💖,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking friends, which is the intended negative tone. The use of ""so proud"" suggests an extremely positive view on their relationships, making it a clear example of sarcasm.","No

Reasoning: The phrase ""I'm so proud of my friends"" is an example of hyperbole, suggesting that one's feelings towards their friends have been greatly exaggerated to highlight the friendship. In this context, it could be interpreted as a self-deprecating comment rather than sarcasm.",0,True
update my gran called me an emo and walked out,"No

Reasoning:
The use of the phrase ""update my gran called me an emo and walked out"" indicates sarcasm, as it's clearly meant to be an ironic way of expressing frustration or anger towards someone, especially one they don't like. The tone suggests that the person writing this text was angry or upset at their friend's behavior, which fits the definition of being a ""Emo"" (emotion) in this context.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they're updating their grandmother's opinion but then says ""walked out,"" which implies sarcasm, as it suggests the user didn't really listen to them.",0,True
I would like to dedicate my hot girl summer to the Eastpointe Chick-Fil-A. Thank you!,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or insulting someone's sexual preference or behavior, which can be considered sarcasm due to its extreme nature and direct accusation against it.","No

Reasoning: The speaker uses hyperbole (""I would like to dedicate my hot girl summer to"") while also using sarcasm (""thank you! "") which creates an ironic effect suggesting that their intention was not clear enough in their statement. However, this doesn't negate the sarcastic nature of the phrase itself.",1,False
"Fuck, an Insomniac developed Wolverine game?!  Someone REALLY wants me to get a PS5.

Probably the corporations *sigh*","No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking and sarcastically accusing the person speaking of wanting to purchase a PlayStation 5 (""Fuck"" to indicate they have a negative opinion), implying that it's a violation of their personal desires or wishes to own a gaming system. It also sounds like a statement of fact, which would be expected in a sarcastic response. The tone is intentionally dismissive and critical, making it clear that the author has no positive feelings towards owning a PlayStation 5 himself.","No

Reasoning: The quote implies that someone has taken a step in the right direction by developing games for the PS5, but it's not clear if they're trying to be politically correct or just plain being sarcastic. The tone suggests a sense of frustration or disappointment at having to play games on a different platform than one desires, which aligns more with sarcasm rather than a true political stance.",0,True
the absolute worst part of my job is the fact that i have to call people on the phone :|,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""the absolute worst part"" indicates sarcasm and implies a negative aspect of the job described in the text.","No

Reasoning:

Can a burrito change the world?  Don't miss Chipotle's first Game Day commercial  https://t.co/IkCNfSARJD #bonuspoints,"No

Reasoning: The quote mentions a ""Game Day"" commercial from Chipotle, which implies that it's being promoted as part of their anniversary celebration rather than a product offering itself to customers. Therefore, while it might be humorous in its own right, it also has an ironic twist suggesting that Chipotle might not actually offer a real game-day experience but rather some kind of promotional campaign for a future event.","No

Reasoning:
This text is clearly mocking or sarcastically accusing the person who wrote it, which makes it an example of sarcasm. The use of ""Chipotle's first Game Day commercial"" is likely intended to be ironic as they have only had one Game Day in their history and this seems like a significant promotion for their brand, making it a fitting reference point for satire.",0,True
being a head nodder in zoom university is a curse,"No

Reasoning:
This statement uses an ironic reference to someone else's experience at Zoom University, which makes it sound like they would have difficulty with the platform, rather than just being a ""head nodder."" It also contains sarcasm through the ""curse"" that follows, implying that the person speaking might not be able to fully utilize the platform because of their background. The humor comes from this unexpected twist on a common stereotype about the Zoom experience.","No

Reasoning: The phrase ""being a head nodder in zoom university is a curse"" implies that the speaker finds such behavior to be offensive or inappropriate, which is a clear sign of sarcasm. The use of ""head nodder"" also suggests a negative connotation, further emphasizing the intended irony.",0,True
Has anyone written about the complexity of sick leave for the service/retail industry and how impossible it is not to screw over the other workers with it? does that make sense? I need an academic article on this with better words,"No

Reasoning:
The provided text seems to be asking for an academic article discussing the complexities of sick leave in the service/retail industry, which suggests they may have found an answer elsewhere. The sarcasm is present because they seem to imply that the topic should already be known, but the fact that they're seeking it themselves indicates they think it's a complex issue worth researching.

This could indicate:

1. They've been working on this specific aspect of their career.
2. They believe","No

Reasoning: The user expresses frustration at not finding clear information in an academic article, suggesting they're looking for more nuanced responses rather than just ""complexity"" comments.",0,True
"sorry folks,,, but new t swift album bangs","No

Reasoning:
The use of ""bangs"" instead of the intended word ""boom"" in this context suggests an exaggerated or mocking tone, which fits the definition of sarcasm. The text is not actually sarcastic but rather a play on words to convey anger or frustration about the album's release.","No

Reasoning: The quote mentions ""new T Swift album bangs"", which directly contradicts the given text suggesting an apology from a musician. Therefore, this would be a clear instance of sarcasm.",0,True
In '04 my parents had to D R A G me to see Napoleon Dynamite in theatres cause i thought it would be a boring flick abt Napoleon Boneparte,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking and sarcastically accusing the person's parents of making him feel bad about seeing a film he didn't enjoy, which implies that his family might have been influenced by this idea. Therefore, the sarcasm comes from the fact that the person doesn't like the film, not just because they felt bad for him but also out of a sense of injustice to their parents.","No

Reasoning: The quote mentions seeing Napoleon Dynamite in theatres as ""boring"", which implies the movie was expected to be a boring one for most people at the time. This directly contradicts the sarcastic tone of the original text.",0,True
Great start to the day Neros was shut and now I'm going akip on the bus 😴😵,"No

Reasoning:
The use of ""Great start to the day"" suggests excitement and enthusiasm, which is likely exaggerated or ironic in light of the abrupt cessation of an activity (Shutting down a service) that would normally be followed by more normal activities. The statement then shifts focus back to the person who just took a public transit, indicating a sense of relief from their recent experience.

This interpretation of sarcasm seems appropriate given the context. It's common for people who have experienced sudden events (","No

Reasoning: The user expresses surprise at the closure of Neros (presumably a subway station) while they are on a public transport bus, suggesting they were expecting a service interruption but instead experienced it as an expected stop in their daily commute. This reaction indicates sarcasm rather than irony.",1,False
I forgot my keys omds I had to message my brother on roblox to open the door,"No

Reasoning:
The statement ""I forgot my keys"" doesn't necessarily indicate an attempt at sarcasm because it's more about forgetting something, which could be a normal human reaction. The user then goes on to mention sending a message to their brother in Roblox to open the door, indicating they were expecting someone to come over to help them.

Therefore, this appears to be just another way of expressing forgetfulness or inability to contact anyone, not indicative of sarcasm.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they forgot their keys, which could be seen as a mild hint that the situation might not be perfect (or at least not one they expected), but also implies there's an issue with their physical possession rather than a problem with their mind. Therefore, this seems like a typical sarcastic response.",0,True
trying to figure out how to use notion for my anime list. I think i’m dying,"No

Reasoning:
The user is expressing frustration because they can't find the way to use Notion for their Anime List project. The sarcasm comes from implying that using it wouldn't work properly or being unable to understand the command instructions due to not understanding their own codebase.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they're ""dying,"" which suggests they're struggling in some way, likely related to using a software like Notion for managing their anime lists. This implies that they might not be happy about it, hence the sarcasm.",1,False
&amp;&amp; If I see one more tweet about someone confusing Joe Budden and Joe Biden I’m really gonna lose it bc the election is around the corner people. Get it togetha (U.S people),"No

Reasoning: The quote expresses frustration at seeing negative reactions to an already divisive issue, likely related to the recent controversy over Joe Biden's presidential ambitions. It suggests a strong desire for clarity and unity, which aligns with sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.","No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking or deriding the use of names like ""Joe"" and ""Joe Biden"", which have become common in popular culture and politics due to their association with Democrats and former Presidents. The sarcasm lies in suggesting that this will result in losing one's job because of this name association.",0,True

https://t.co/WWiGmAE7VU 

#cats #birthday #catpillow #decorativepillow #catcushion #petpillow #throwpillow #kittypillow #catlovergift #homemade https://t.co/SACNODCW5t","No, because it's not really sarcasm at all. It's just some people who like cats buying them as gifts. The quote mentions ""handmade cushions"", which could be interpreted as suggesting that these were made using natural materials such as wool or sheepskin instead of being mass-produced.","No. The text expresses enthusiasm about handmade cushion pillows, which implies that they might be better than traditional ones but don't explicitly say it's because of their ""handmade"" nature.",0,True
i like starting conversations with “also” even though there was no proceeding sentence,"No

Reasoning:
This statement uses the phrase ""proceeding sentence,"" which implies that you're trying to get someone into an argument or discussion about a specific topic, rather than engaging in a constructive conversation. It's common for people to start conversations without explicitly stating an ongoing subject, especially when they want to initiate a discussion quickly. The use of ""also"" here is a play on words, suggesting both a continuation of the initial thought (which could be interpreted as a rhetorical question) and","No

Reasoning: The phrase ""also"" in this context suggests an attempt to start a discussion without providing any actual content, which could be seen as ironic or sarcastic if one assumes that someone is looking for more information on a topic before engaging in a conversation.

However, it's possible that the speaker might have had another idea or question they wanted to ask that wasn't mentioned at the beginning of their statement. Therefore, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a sarcastic response; rather,",0,True
"FaceTimed with my parents last night while they were with my 6-year-old nephew. I’ve been missing him like crazy worried about being away from him for months, so I asked him if he remembers me. His response?
“I always will.” ❤️❤️❤️","No

Reasoning: The speaker mentions that they ""have been missing him"" and then asks if his parents remember them, implying that they don't have good communication about their children's whereabouts. This suggests sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.","No

Reasoning:
The use of the phrase ""I've been missing him like crazy"" implies that this was something significant that has been bothering or frustrating them, which could be seen as sarcasm rather than genuine concern. The statement itself doesn't inherently show sarcasm but the tone suggests it's a matter of frustration, which aligns more with an expression of annoyance rather than genuine concern.",0,True
Don't understand the scoring on #AllStarMusicals ? How has everyone got 10s apart from Barney? His was the best so far by quite a bit,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking or sarcastically accusing the person who wrote it, which makes it an example of sarcasm rather than just a comment about musical scores. The language used is derogatory, implying unfairness in how they scored songs, suggesting that only one song deserves praise because it's by a specific artist. This kind of offensive language would be considered a clear case of sarcasm, not just an expression of opinion.","No

Reasoning: The user is making an accusation about a specific score (Barney's) and then questioning it based on that, which suggests they have a bias against this score or someone else who scored similarly. This type of language would be indicative of sarcasm rather than a simple comment.",0,True
@Jamie0Sharp Always ❤️,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking Jamie 0 Sharp, which is an ironic response to his positive sentiment towards someone named Jamie. The use of ""Always ❤️"" (always) is not in line with the intended meaning of the original text and should be considered sarcastic.","No

Reasoning: The user responds in an ironic tone to a positive comment about Jamie Sharp (presumably referring to an American rapper), suggesting that they have not been impressed by his work since he moved to America. This aligns with the typical sarcastic reaction to someone's success in another culture, which could be interpreted as a form of mockery or sarcasm towards the author.",0,True
Who's ready for monsoon storms allllll weekend?!?!,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""monsoon storms"" implies a strong and sudden weather event that may be unpredictable or severe, which could be interpreted as an insult to those who are not fully prepared for such events. This suggests sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.","Yes

Reasoning: The use of ""alllllll"" in this context clearly indicates sarcasm and hyperbole, which would make it very inappropriate to respond with a ""yes"".",1,False
evERYTHING IS NOT A COMPETITION OF WHO HAD/HAS IT WORSE OK BYEEE,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""EVERYTHING IS NOT A COMPETITION"" suggests that everything has equal value regardless of its impact or outcome, implying that no one should be held accountable for their actions based on how they affect others. This aligns well with the context provided in the text, which criticizes the idea that competition shouldn't exist as it would not benefit anyone but rather create chaos and conflict. Therefore, this text does not appear to be a sarcastic response but rather a","No

Reasoning:
This statement uses hyperbole and sarcasm to emphasize how everything deserves equal attention and importance, which can be interpreted as criticism or ridicule towards those who have done worse. The tone is mocking and dismissive, making it more likely to be seen as an insult rather than a sarcastic remark.",0,True
@cassieecote413 you can copy mine,"No

Reasoning: The quote ""you can copy mine"" suggests that the poster wants to be credited for their content, which isn't typically encouraged on social media platforms like this one. Therefore, it's likely sarcastic in nature.","No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or insulting someone else's work by taking credit for it without permission. It doesn't have sarcasm as defined in the context of using humor to make a point about copyright. Therefore, this text does not qualify as sarcastic according to our definition of sarcasm.",1,False
The @Pontifex talks benefits of universal basic income #COVID19  #coronavirus #catholic #EasterSunday https://t.co/2e2BCmroVk,"No

Reasoning:
This post is clearly mocking or deriding the idea of Universal Basic Income (UBI), which many people consider an idealistic concept that advocates for providing free public services to everyone rather than focusing on individual needs or economic stability. The comment is sarcastically pointing out the absurdity of advocating for something without actually believing in it, implying that UBI is not a realistic or practical solution to the current crisis like the pandemic.","No

Reasoning: The quote mentions ""universal basic income"" which could imply something related to helping people in need rather than benefiting from it. This further suggests sarcasm since it's not directly relevant to the content of the post about Easter Sunday.",0,True
"@CBoyForeman @RaleighBikes_UK @MadnessNews I had an orange one! Around the same time as you as well, great memories.","No

Reasoning: The quote mentions a ""great memory"" from around the same time, which implies that the person was indeed in a similar situation at some point, making this sarcastic comment.","No

Reasoning:
This post seems to be responding to someone else's experience with an Orange bike, likely from Raleigh, which would make it appear sarcastic. However, the tone also suggests that this response may be mocking the commenter for sharing their own experience with another bike brand, implying that the person who shared theirs wasn't ""good"" enough to share a specific bike model. Thus, the sarcasm appears in both contexts - the commenter was sharing their Orange bike experience, while the post seemed",0,True
ive been watching british streamers for too long. i caught myself saying aircon instead of AC,"No

Reasoning: The user mentions they've watched British streamers ""for too long"", which implies sarcasm or an expression of frustration with their current viewing habits, suggesting this isn't just a normal observation but rather something more serious related to their current streaming habits.","No

Reasoning:
This statement is an example of sarcasm because it highlights the contradiction between using ""AC"" as an abbreviation for ""air conditioning"" (which is used in many countries to refer to air conditioning) and the English term ""acorn,"" which means an acorn tree in England, referring to its shape rather than being used for cooling purposes. The contradiction is so obvious that it can be interpreted sarcastically, even though the speaker was not aware of this difference at the time.",0,True

The tone is dismissive, implying that such information should not be shared publicly or that people have been duped by this person.",0,True
I think I'm restarting my YouTube channel 🙊,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or jokingly suggesting that the user may be starting their YouTube channel anew, which would typically indicate sarcasm rather than an ironic suggestion about restarts.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they're ""restarting"" their YouTube channel, which implies they're trying to get rid of it or clear its content for whatever reason, not because they're restarting it as in starting from zero again. This indicates sarcasm towards their past actions, suggesting they might be intentionally deleting the content or channels due to some internal conflict or change in plans.",0,True
