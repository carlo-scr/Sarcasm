269,Shout out James Boswell  #unibowl,1,"No

Reasoning: The quote mentions ""James Boswell"" but then goes on to mention an unibowler (a term for a team that plays at Uniswap), so there's no contradiction here. The phrase itself doesn't imply any sarcasm, it just references someone who has played at Uniswap.","No

2255,My mouth while drunk….. unstoppable,0,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""my mouth while drunk"" is an idiom that literally means ""I'm going to vomit right now"" which is not related to drinking and speaking freely. It's more of a metaphorical expression rather than a literal one, so it would be considered absurdly ironic.","No

Reasoning:
This statement uses an idiom that suggests something completely outlandish and contradictory to everyday experience, which fits the definition of sarcasm as described in the text.

Reasoning: The quote implies that time spent on computers was necessary for survival, which doesn't fit the sarcastic tone described in the text. It seems more like a personal anecdote rather than a comment on the user's experience with their limitations.","No

Reasoning:
The statement is ironic because it implies that the person has limited time available for gaming (one hour per day) while also being restricted to just one hour each day due to physical limitations, which would make it impossible to ""survive"".
