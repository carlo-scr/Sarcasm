notsarc,5302,Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................

notsarc,1013,"Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt."
notsarc,1650,"Well, there's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development, such that we can confidently say no ""person"" is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy.I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester.IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance."
notsarc,5290,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
notsarc,1093,Do you see the other cities pushing for outrageous standards like NYC?
sarc,3822,"Obviously because they're not chickens yet XD 
Oh wait they're chicken EGGS right *thinks* no matter they have absolutely nothing to in common with chickens they're some freaky alien species!

notsarc,538,You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html
sarc,2903,LOL no kidding. If you took all the nut jobs out of political rallies there would only be eight people left...and the candidate might be gone as well.
notsarc,2063,But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it.
notsarc,120,If you truly believe this then I think you need to re-read your posts and put yourself in the shoes of those on the receiving end. 
sarc,3007,"Do you wish to be compared to a newly fertilized egg?
Have you compared a human being to a zygote perhaps? How did it turn out? What if you did the comaprison from the point of view of an alien species with a different biology? Would you conclude that a zygote and a human being are equivalent?"
notsarc,2369,"why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom."

notsarc,1149,They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.
notsarc,5586,"I don't have any belief in this area. I don't know how life started and accept that I probably never will know. It might have started through a God ""magicking"" the first cell into existence, it may have started through purely random natural processes or anywhere in between the two. One only has belief and faith in this regard when one claims to know how life started. ""I don't know"" is not belief."

Furthermore, the human rights act, specifically talks about protecting the unborn too. You lose"
notsarc,1052,"Oh I hated being pregnant. However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment, I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy. ;) Julie - however clearly feels that it is acceptable to use a pregnancy and parenting in a punitive matter against women she feels are irresponsible."
sarc,4158,"What prompted this?
I guess I need to check what website I'm in...
Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me.

But, carry on, Orion. You've shown your true colors now. Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes"
notsarc,396,"Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)"

"
notsarc,2254,"We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now."
notsarc,5714,"Well, you know what happens when they try to eliminate waste. The opponents start screaming that the government is ""rationing"" health care.   In any case the inclusion of the 40 million uninsured wil be financed mostly by waste elimination. At least it is a start. The status quo is untenable.   The essential point here is that the universal healthcare systems in Europe, Japan and Canada deliver MORE healthcare for less money. It is not the case that in Canada, healtcare is in short supply because the government is rationing it. They are ahead of us in all metrics except waiting time for non-essential surgery. One example is the waiting time in emergency rooms as some of us have actually experienced. We may not be able to achieve the same efficiency overnight but we have to stop putting our head in the sand."
sarc,5182," and in the case of all prenatal medicine  it is the pregnant woman who is the patient  not the fetus. Shouldn't a doctor be able to act in the interests of the patient without fear of imprisonment? IIRC  this was the issue most important to Justice Harry Blackmun (a conservative appointed by Richard Nixon) who authored the court's opinion on Roe v. Wade.The Roe v. Wade Opinion"" a doctor can't kill someone else to save the life of another, so I would say that is probably not a good arguement. Not only that, find \right to privacy\"" in the constitution...oh wait  not there. Guess its on the back."" "
sarc,4672,"So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?"
notsarc,660,"But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law."
sarc,4865,"Oh goody. Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking, no research and even less actual thought. Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi). Yes, it is flightless because it has no need to fly. There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird. It swims and eats fish. It's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by ""flying"" through the water like a penguin. Like the penguin it is a diving bird."
notsarc,147,"No it isn't. There was an incident here in the states last year that had an elderly woman beaten and raped, and several days later her rapist came back to do it again and she killed him on the spot. She wasn't brought to court to face trial even know she killed someone.THAT is how something like this should be handled."
sarc,5089,That isn't the arguement your buddy made. He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that.   Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master. He didn't mention how the snake felt   Also said something about robots and guns but didn't have any examples to wow us with. Do you?
sarc,3691,"Don't you ever get tired of acting like a little kid?
Heaven forbid anyone who actually know what you think but you can bet it is another juvenile..."
sarc,4579,So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
notsarc,76,"Perhaps an analogy. Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink (personally against it, for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose. So, you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are ""pro-choice"" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves).Pro-life would be: You don't drink and smoke (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either."
sarc,6283,"Are you blind, or can't you read? NATO just provided evidence right now.

notsarc,5781,"But I already pointed out the mark of Cain in another thread.   http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...57&amp;postcount=1   You see, this particular gene has but two alleles. One exists in the majority of humans. That allele, along with several other genes involved in pigmentation create people with various shades of brown to very brown skin. The second allele was created by a more recent mutation and spread in a more limited population. That allele produces white skin."
sarc,3828,The Archbishop of York has a screw loose too on that subject.

notsarc,1900,"No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system."
sarc,2851,"Lol.. you are so silly. I also see you love shifting the burden of proof, and into making grandiose claims. Bring it on, bring it on.
Your opinion is noted and laughed at. I do love your rants though.
I do have to wonder, I never clashed with you about the existence of Jesus in this current nick. What was your old one, and why the nickname change? Banned under the old one?"
sarc,5167,"You mean I can get pregnant all by myself! COOL! Out with the men. They have been ticking me off for YEARS!   Well, where should we draw the line with men? At what point is it OK for the government to take control rather than letting men make choices for their bodies?   For me. Nothing less than I ALWAYS MAKE MY OWN CHOICES FOR MY BODY is acceptable and anything else is violation."

notsarc,877,"Not in this instance, no. It isnt trying to parallel pregnancy per se(though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months), but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent. If the pro-life mantra is to be believed, it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do. So, the argument is applicable for 9 days, 9 months, 9 years or forever."
notsarc,5339,"So Pat is an example of gonadal dysgenesis (or an intersexual.) Are you sure it is correct to describe this condition as being ""made-up of two genetically distinct people""? Is is not the case that Pat is one genetically distinct person made up of two complete chromosome sets?"

Would you accuse them of taking delight in the number of car deaths? 
notsarc,653,"I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not."

It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing."

There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. "

notsarc,1083,"Right. We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god.

notsarc,5831,Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.
notsarc,5415,"Again that is a poor analogy. Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution. Quite the opposite, it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution.Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons, in fact it DOES NOT. According to the 10th Amendment:The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.Thus you have another poor analogy.

Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)"
notsarc,1758,"first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them."

The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.
sarc,6326,"I love this line. I assume by ""harm"" you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another (physical in this case includes loss of items). So this would cut our laws in half.

notsarc,1385,Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange.

notsarc,1686,"Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events."

Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to ""purpose."" And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."

But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country.

All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant.

I would say that Darwin's original argument from suboptimal design still holds as an argument against special creation, where each species is said to have been created de novo. But it doesn't rule out Intelligent Design, as an adjunct to evolution by natural selection. I agree that the argument from homology plus genetic evidence makes Intelligent Design less appealing. Of course, the bottom line is that there is plenty of evidence for natural selection (along with genetic drift, gene flow, and sexual selection) as a natural mechanism for evolution, and ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR ID. This total lack of evidence for ID plus its failure to prove that natural selection could not have accounted for complexity in living organisms is really all that is needed to dismiss it at this point."

Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that ""theory"". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis. Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out. "

notsarc,1684,"They originally might have been an arbitrary guess, but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true (at least the existence of the outside world, the others are abstract logical concepts that don't have a physical reality, just an abstract one)."
notsarc,5696,"Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4. We did not envent it, it aways existed. Same with logic, its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe. But in the atheists worldview, only the meterial universe exists."
notsarc,1151,"First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape/incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off.But of course you are missing the whole point.You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice.I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health.If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape/incest victims,for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons?"

notsarc,5262,"and tell me what did you gain out of making this statement? Just to let you know... the Bible (if you would actually read it in context instead of reading a little portion that you want to and interpret it the way you want outside of its context).. teaches how to love... because God is love.. and laid down his own life so that we could be FREE! hmmm.... sounds like the motto of what our troops do for our country... they lay their lives down because they want us to be free... where do you think this ""ideology"" comes from???"
notsarc,993,"""He"" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality.

They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on. FAA News"

sarc,4296,"Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the ""right"" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say ""All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages"". Since we have ""a government for the people by the people"", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people.

sarc,4404,"1984, huh? I'm sure that is all still very relevant. Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx. Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional."

Of course those will be used in a arguments completely irrevelant to them, but considering how you keep using the WWII fallacy to distract the discussion away from your own failure, you shouldn't have any problem no?"
sarc,3249,"I'm afraid I don't recall ever saying that. Surely if I said it, you could produce some evidence, right?

notsarc,2394,"Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work.

It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say.

But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself."
notsarc,1029,"(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?"
notsarc,5388,I think her point was that the pope is biased because he's catholic.

sarc,3109,"Yea I guess you're right, you people tend to blur together after a time."
sarc,4962,If the same question had been posed by different polls over time it would be easier to draw trends from the responses..... but good luck with finding some trends in amongst that lot.
notsarc,5345,"Bad, bad, bad. :( 1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.1) Some, perhaps all ""Livestock feed"" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten."

sarc,3226,"Well then, I guess I must be a turkey-sandwich worshipper! emoticonXAngel"
sarc,6360,"So scientists are doing science, lots of it. Check the August 2007 issue of Evolution, for example. On the other hand IDists produce nothing, do no lab work, but just harp and harangue against evolution. As the article says, ""Its passionate diatribes virtually advertise the program they attack. People must fight for something that they want to achieve, not simply reject an evil, however bad it may be. Shoe fits you lot, WW, not us."
notsarc,235,"emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking ""what they would need"" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of ""doesn't this look like ..."", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests.

notsarc,703,Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
sarc,3815,"Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).
It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.
What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???
As to this case.
I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.
But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock."

notsarc,5521,"No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time. The age of the Universe is irrelevent."
sarc,4466,"Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory."
sarc,3269,"Why am I not surprised chester, that chloe directly giving an in depth answer to you is perceived as not being germane to the topic. Since you never directly answer any proposition forwarded as you derail every thread by just serving up your off topic tripe. emoticonXGood

If they use The Holy Bible as a guide, then they better read it a little closer. The Bible says that if you're sick, seek a doctor.If you don't like what a doctor says, go to another. If he gives you a prescription, go get it filled. If Jack's Drug Store won't fill it, go to Ajax Drugs, etc, etc.You can't force morality on anyone, anyway. At least that's what I've found...and I don't do it for a living.On edit: How do you edit a poll? I meant to click on ""NO"", but I hit ""Don't Know""I feel like one of Bill Cosby's kids.... :)"

sarc,6114,"On the evidence, that must have been where his brain was located."
sarc,4978,"Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators. Why don't you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime (gun control).   However, if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control, then go for it! Maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence."

notsarc,5421,"It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific."

notsarc,5702,"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/science/03angi.html.   I've had three children, which gave me an opportunity to observe intimately the development of infants. Also, I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older, and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are. At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence. No! No! No! are the bywords of a two-year-old. No! I won't! And you can't make me!"
notsarc,1708,"But no one is trying to disprove it.
 
 But, the burden of any proof is on those making a positive claim.
 
 Unless there is a way to test for a designer, intellegent design is not science."
notsarc,2110,"Hello there. The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty (I am one) is this: We are talking of innocent life. The death penalty is justified for a person who is guilty of commiting a crime against a society that has that law. The child never did anything wrong. I know of other beleivers who don't support the death penalty, so basically, it's an in-house debate."
notsarc,5843,Sorry. Disasterous work week. Will post today if that's still okay.   Appologies for the delay.
sarc,2645,Aw declare victory and slither off eh. I made an assertof fact that was backed up. You made a strawman of abandonment. No one made that claim but you. They come here because they don't get the proceedure in a timely manner. Get it now? Hence you lose as usual.
notsarc,2266,you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing
notsarc,1752,"How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry."

sarc,3916,"How and in what context?

notsarc,5357,"Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right."
sarc,4463,"What, to be ""open-minded?"" or to embrace your definition of ""tolerance?"""
notsarc,1364,"And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?"
notsarc,336,"Another lie.
 
 The sentence you've quoted never made any such argument."
notsarc,1681,And that's what I'm talking about. It doesn't have to have been 'explained' to me. I already know that's your view.
sarc,5975,"Please do, because according to your source McVeigh called himself an Agnostic.

notsarc,1598,"At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?"

sarc,4541,"Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that ""evolution"" has anything to do with the Bible.

They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science.

It should be reported BEFORE the victim is aware of any pregnancy. Coming forth weeks or months after the fact is too suspicious and gives the appearance that they are just crying rape as an excuse for a justified abortion."

The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as ""evidence"" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is."
notsarc,493,"That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory."

Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? ."

That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right."

The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks."

Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an idiot and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves."

notsarc,5562,So although you provide absolutely no evidence or source to back up this claim we should just accept that the memo is authentic until some disproves it? How does such reasoning even begin to make sense?I'm very suspicious about the legitimacy of such a memo. Here are two bogus quotes attributed to Sarah Brady by some people on the pro-gun side:
sarc,2700,"I'm British, from England, Manchester, the place where those that invented the first car, computer, railway and where the industrial revolution started.
Definitely not from the USA where youre more credited with stuff like the first gay bishop, etc, etc, lame!"
sarc,5936,"I will give you definite proof that I am the king of Spain when you prove your false claims.
You made your assertions first so you prove them first.

If you call your diktat, ""productive dialogue"", then you must be employed by 'The Department of Truth', or whatever they're calling it these days. And since to you ""scientific"" means, solely and only, ""materialist/mechanist"", right from the jump, there never was any chance of 'dialogue' taking place.
"
notsarc,657,That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
sarc,6355,Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.
notsarc,2557,"When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified."
notsarc,1479,"Actually, the fact that children of gay parents are no more likely to be gay than children of straight parents directly refutes the original article.Children of gay parents have only one gender, which the original article pointed to as a cause for homosexuality.If NARTH's article pretends to talk about the impact of a missing gender, then Charliegone's article directly refutes."
notsarc,1142,"As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity."

notsarc,1349,"That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your ""apple falling"" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. "
sarc,3196,"Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. 
So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?
What?? No where to be found?? Gasp."
notsarc,978,"**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism."

It's actually a remarkably simple thing to do when you realise that Nature is just far too complex to have been designed.   Look around you. We humans are perhaps the best designers that we know of. Look how crude are the things we make: the filthy, inefficient combustion engine; the computer, unable to make decisions of its own and unable to feel emotions; the microwave, unable to cool anything like a tasty meal. We are, at best, crude emulators of Nature.   No. No designer could possibly have kept track of all the interlocking wonders of the natural world, therefore there can't possibly have been one.   Also, the chances of a designer appearing ab initio in the Universe are of the order 1 in 5x10^90871. I worked it out.   I'll let the Discovery Institute know."
notsarc,5704,"Actually, they are genetic. Our cells have receptors which are triggered by exposure to pathogens; that's how we ""learn"" to fight off a disease.

I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can."

notsarc,748,"The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. "

Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers.

Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!"
notsarc,1157,Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.
notsarc,5596,"That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb."

sarc,6478,NO! And it has nothing to do with expressing views different from mine. These XXXXXX are spending good money to advertise against a God they believe PROBABLY doesn't exist. All I have to say is thanks for proving how irrational and stupid atheists are.
notsarc,5818,"And certain versions of Mark:   15He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.   Are they mistakenly reading this?"

sarc,6066,"**
You are very, very good at pretending that what your apponent says is invisible. Your repetition of the same fatuous inanity, (as always, phrased as evasive rhetorical questions instead of honest declarations of opinion), is nothing but a repetition of the objection I demolished in the very post you are quoting.
And here's another flash, socrates. The fact that some organisms die, for any number of reasons, sooner than some of their relatives do, explains exactly nothing. The insinuation that this survival differential has some universal, as opposed to local, efficient cause, is pure fecal matter. And that's all you've got, wiseguy. A simple fact of life, and an insinuated cause, and you think they add up to evolution. Breathtakingly simple-minded assumption, fella.

What probable cause was there? None. I had buddy of mine arrested because he was posing with legally held firearms that someone at his college ""ratted"" him out on him having ""illegal"" ones. There was nothing illegal but he was a. thrown in jail. b. spent thousands in lawyer fees c. never got his guns back. c. had to leave his position as student body president...and the police? ""We are sorry about that. Oh well."" You see what I mean? Gotta love LAPD."
notsarc,5324,"But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the ""right to abortion"" ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied. It's not the Court's function to legislate from the bench. It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected."

notsarc,5554,And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.

sarc,4114,Are we talking about the place Jesus and the Jews believed in or the one later Christians made up to keep people in check?
notsarc,5348,"You can check the statistical relationship between dozens of variables, not the effects of them.For example if I correlated left hand strength with right hand strength across a billion individuals I would probably find a correlation of about 0.93, however this relationship is not causal, cutting off one hand will not result in a 90% strength reduction in the other.Correlational studies like this one can not determine cause and effect."

notsarc,5434,"Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???"

Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!"

As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.

sarc,4505,"A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one."
sarc,3602,Your glittering generalizations doom you to the point of mediocrity. Just another attempt at propaganda everyone is tired of.
notsarc,641,The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.
sarc,3739,"A magnanimous troll is nearly an oxymoron but you are a complete m*ron.
NATO was making a valid statement not being a victim..you are the one with the chip on your shoulder whineyemoticonXClown"
notsarc,770,Both. It's where a human life begins but not a life yet.
notsarc,2183,"So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)"
notsarc,1155,"The first article is from 2002 and the second one is from 2006, molecular genetics changed massively over that period of time with the completition of the human genome project and the development of new technology. What they would be looking at and comparing would have changed drastically as well, from just the genes in the first case (the 99% figure) and everything in the second (94%)."
sarc,4297,"What do I have against abortion? Hmmm, let me think. I guess there is that little fact that it is MURDER! But besides that ""opinion"", it does effect me because it effects society in a negative way. Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions? Look here to see what I mean. Do a search for ""effects of abortion"" on the Web and see if you don't find many more studies with the same results. I could have posted many more links. Maybe you don't know about these studies since the leftist media and women's groups tends to ignore them. Maybe you just ignore them because they don't fit into your world view. Either way, the facts are there."
notsarc,401,"Well, since you've called those who've disagreed with you here stupid (and variations thereof), and insinuated that they're too stoned to understand you, I think you have the most ground to make up. You also provide no support for your statements, most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda."
sarc,4126,"oh ok, so I assume you don't live in your own house? I was trying to picture over 61 people fitting into one house. :)"
notsarc,1811,"And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that."
sarc,4946,More silliness on your part. Think about it. Gay couples together for 40 or 50 years. That means they were living together in the 1950s and 1960s. Those people were the foundation of the gay-pride movement.
notsarc,873,"Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of ""arms"" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case."
sarc,3994,"Aww, you didn't read a top criminoligist I quoted before did you?
The ""Myth"" of Gun Trafficking
You also didn't check out mexidata.com either did you?
Now you need proof to back up your alligator mouth. Where's the beef sliiiiick?"
notsarc,1706,"Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person."
sarc,3670,"I only asked that question to see how much stupid stuff I could get Freedom to say.
So far nothing he has said is correct.
I am guessing he is a religious person."
sarc,3473,"Both statements are factual. It's only your limited grasp of reality that makes them confusing.
"
notsarc,475,"That's not entirely true. For example, a country that isn't already saturated with, say, handguns, would imo greatly suffer if handguns were suddenly legalised. Banning handguns in a country that is saturated already, is imo, idiotic.

sarc,4657,"In that case a man in a coma is not a person then, is he?"
notsarc,285,"Yes, I'm always a step behind the word definition switcharoos. I have been told many times on 4forums that abiogenesis is not science."

sarc,6172,Not the best school system there although the Mayor has a nice car I hear emoticonXClown
notsarc,1828,And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.
notsarc,1857,"I disagree, I need you to show me what part of reason is BASED on faith of a rational creator, based on evidence (includes things that are self-evident). Unless you want me to accept your claim on faith!!   -Mach"
notsarc,2327,"Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other."
sarc,3679,Is that right next to ANWR? Are the Canadians downplaying ANWR while they side drill to extract our precious fluids? emoticonXClown
sarc,2799,"I love how you anti equality conservatives become bogeymen the instant something like this is passed. Threatening with judgment, death, hate, killings, gee everyone if we don't keep the status quo the world might end!
I guess the world is falling apart for people like you. It doesn't really surprise me.
"
notsarc,685,"Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them."
sarc,5877,And it seems that the only thing that repulses you is religion. Curious... emoticonXRolleyes
notsarc,5792,I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.
sarc,3156,"He was referring to the mimivirus which does NOT act like any other virus. Some of you people need to study a little harder :) 
"
notsarc,1220,"Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function."
sarc,6168,"There are somewhere between 10 and 20 million gay people is America. 10,000 is a small minority, yes. And even your article admits this number is unsubstantiated, AA. More lying for JESUS."
notsarc,699,"They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered.""During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother's death as a result of exhaustion, dehydration, infection, hemorrhage, or convulsions. Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children, her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8. This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."""
sarc,3824,Ha! There are a lot more gay owned and straight non-homophobic or non-religious businesses than that. Thanks for the cheap and clueless stereotype though!
sarc,2685,"And how is that? Your stereotypical view is supposed to represent ""truth""?? LMAO. B**** (and I mean that ""lovingly"") I'm friggin married. For 10 years. I don't accept ""gay sex proposals"", unless it's from my husband. And he ain't ""white"". I had my flings with y'all....and y'all ain't right. I moved on. 
And learn to use English ""correctly"". A remedial English course is recommended. And I have never lived in Sodom. I'm a Houstonian. B^^^^."
sarc,4213,Well I know that's where your people got their start. Right out of the left rear flank of a large fore-headed knuckle-dragger.
sarc,6331,"Yeah.. caught that... But, hey.. I think you made a mistake."
sarc,4565,"You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures."
sarc,3488,"
well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback"
notsarc,996,"Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that ""incipient organ"" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying ""what good is half a wing."" Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does ""fully functional"" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly."
sarc,2726,"This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!

sarc,6495,"VOR - You're a rude piece of ****. Don't worry, I just calls them as I sees them. If it offends you, then I'm terribly sorry that I pointed out that you were a rude piece of ****."
notsarc,2570,"You JUST said they get health care in the hospital! Read your post, where's there NO healthcare. And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible."
notsarc,960,"What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed."
sarc,6162,"You mean my dog 'CIgarette'??
I took him out for a drag."
notsarc,5736,Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.
notsarc,190,"The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves."

What is the sound of one hand clapping.....?
Ladywolf,
Your answer will probably come from many different sources. Your idea that it evolved is pretty-much it, IMO."
notsarc,1644,And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
notsarc,263,"Hmm, when you say ""numberless"" do you mean something other than the standard definition of infinite? If not, please explain how an infinite number of organisms could be created in a finite time with finite space and resources. Thank you."
sarc,5886,"Oh, look, removing a quote from its context. How about your address my textbook definition next?
"
notsarc,2206,"23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so."
sarc,5059,Well at least you can't have a drive by swording. You can run from a sword. They are pretty tough to conceal in a bank robbery.
notsarc,1067,"I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly.

sarc,4315,"Oooh, thanks for the quotes! This is proof enough to show that gun control is not a ""modern-day issue"", as Ian has claimed."
notsarc,659,"Its odd that you would use that concept at all. Do you really think terms used to describe power structures in human organizations are applicable to cells and their subsystems? Genes are the heritable information store of cells, they perform their function, other subsystems perform other functions. The whole constitutes a living cell. The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept. What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems. A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy."

notsarc,1982,Give it a rest... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part... no foam.
notsarc,2278,But you can't. You may imagine it but you can't present evidence that supports your position. You can only argue against what you don't understand in the first place. I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic. You don't seem to do the same.
notsarc,2480,"Oh, I don't know that she is any nuttier than the next person.   However I think her opinion is wrong. I also think her argument is not correct. A person can not impose themselves on your property without your consent - and you CAN remove them, and even kill them if they are a threat to you."
notsarc,5830,"Let's hear more. Remember; it is estimated that over 6 billion people were on earth at the time of the flood.   Also, Genesis 1 : 6 thru 1 : 10 - Water was above and below the firmament of Heaven. What happened to the waters that were above the firmament? Was this used for the deluge that covered the earth?   It had never rained before The Flood. Why, if someone made up this story, would they have said such a thing? Wouldn't it be much more believeable if they would have said, ""There had never been such a rain as this...""?"
notsarc,1082,"Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example."
notsarc,2450,"It seems that Prop 8, banning gay marriage passed by around 300+ thousand votes. So the inconsistency persists, unless there was voter fraud that only touched on the top of the ticket which would explain why it appears that more progressives supported Obama than these side issues."
