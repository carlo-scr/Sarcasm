Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................,notsarc,Yes,100.0,Yes,Yes,100.0,Yes.

"Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt.",notsarc,No,100.0,No.,No,100.0,"No. The text is not sarcastic; rather, it expresses disagreement with the argument presented. It suggests that the argument's conclusion is based on faulty reasoning and lacks logical support."
"Well, there's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development, such that we can confidently say no ""person"" is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy.I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester.IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance.",notsarc,No,100.0,"No. The text does not appear to be a criticism of the idea of a person being established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy, but rather a statement from someone who believes that it would be better for women to make their own decisions regarding when",No,100.0,No. The text does not appear to be attacking any particular viewpoint but rather presenting arguments for its own position on the issue of fetuses being considered persons at certain stages of pregnancy. It appears to be an argument against the legal recognition of a fetus as
"Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?",notsarc,No,100.0,No.,No,100.0,"No. The text does not address whether the cost of healthcare has increased in all countries equally, but rather focuses on how much more money it takes to pay for healthcare when there is less insurance coverage. This is because the increase in healthcare costs per capita"
Do you see the other cities pushing for outrageous standards like NYC?,notsarc,Yes,73.54,Yes,Yes,100.0,"Yes

I'm sorry, but I can't agree with that statement. While it's true that some cities are pushing for extremely stringent environmental regulations, this doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing so because of an irrational fear of pollution and climate change"
"Obviously because they're not chickens yet XD 
Oh wait they're chicken EGGS right *thinks* no matter they have absolutely nothing to in common with chickens they're some freaky alien species! 
I like eggs! They're good especially with yellow cheese and salt and pepper. *stomach growls* Oh Sinjin now I'm hungry! Thanks a lot. emoticonXCry",sarc,Yes,100.0,Yes,Yes,100.0,"Yes. It's just another example of the absurdity of trying to compare humans to animals.

This is a classic case of comparing humans to animals, which is an insult to human dignity. We should be grateful for our humanity and appreciate that we are"
You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience.

I didn't say anything was wrong with the ages of the Earth. I just said there's no scientific evidence for any of them. And I'm not sure what you're trying to get at by saying ""all in idiocy""."
LOL no kidding. If you took all the nut jobs out of political rallies there would only be eight people left...and the candidate might be gone as well.,sarc,Yes,100.0,Yes,Yes,100.0,"Yes

I don't understand why this is so confusing. Is it because it's from an older generation that still uses the language of ""nut jobs""? Or is it because of the reference to the election itself? I'm not sure if I can"
But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it.,notsarc,No,56.88,No.,No,66.45,No. The ban on gay marriage is not related to the issue of whether gays and lesbians should have rights. It's an issue about who can legally marry whom and what legal status they will have once married.
If you truly believe this then I think you need to re-read your posts and put yourself in the shoes of those on the receiving end. ,notsarc,Yes,70.37,Yes,No,55.93,No.
